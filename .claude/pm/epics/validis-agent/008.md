# Task: Testing & Safety Validation

## Description
Comprehensive testing suite including query performance tests, timeout validation, safety injection tests, and end-to-end workflow validation for both audit and lending modes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 80% code coverage
- [ ] Query performance tests validate < 3 second response
- [ ] Timeout tests confirm 5-second hard limit
- [ ] Safety injection tests prevent malicious queries
- [ ] Load tests validate 50 concurrent users
- [ ] End-to-end tests for both workflow modes
- [ ] Security tests validate client isolation
- [ ] Integration tests for all API endpoints

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Jest for unit tests, Supertest for API tests
- Key files: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`
- Performance testing with Artillery or K6
- Security testing for SQL injection attempts
- Mock data setup for consistent testing

Test categories:
- Unit Tests: Individual agent and component testing
- Integration Tests: API endpoint and pipeline testing
- Performance Tests: Query execution and response times
- Security Tests: Client isolation, SQL injection prevention
- Load Tests: Concurrent user simulation
- E2E Tests: Complete workflow scenarios

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 002-007 completed
- [ ] Test database with sample data
- [ ] Test environment configuration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24
- Parallel: false (tests the complete system)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test suites passing
- [ ] Code coverage reports generated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Test documentation complete
