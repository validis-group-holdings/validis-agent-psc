# Task: Agent Pipeline Implementation

## Description
Implement the 7 core agents using LangChain framework including Query Parser, Context, Workflow, Schema, SQL Generator, Query Governor, and Response Formatter agents with Anthropic Claude integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Query Parser Agent extracts intent and entities from natural language
- [ ] Context Agent maintains conversation state and history
- [ ] Workflow Agent enforces audit vs lending mode rules
- [ ] Schema Agent maps queries to database structure
- [ ] SQL Generator Agent creates queries using templates
- [ ] Query Governor Agent enforces safety rules
- [ ] Response Formatter Agent generates natural language responses
- [ ] All agents integrated in processing pipeline

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: LangChain's agent framework with custom tools
- Key files: `src/agents/`, `src/pipeline/orchestrator.ts`
- Use Anthropic Claude for NLP tasks
- Implement agent communication via events
- State management using Redis for conversation context
- Error handling and fallback strategies

Agent responsibilities:
- Query Parser: Intent classification, entity extraction
- Context: Session management, conversation memory
- Workflow: Mode enforcement, scoping rules
- Schema: Table mapping, relationship understanding
- SQL Generator: Template selection, parameter binding
- Query Governor: Safety injection, limit enforcement
- Response Formatter: Result summarization, natural language generation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 (Query Safety Layer) completed
- [ ] Task 003 (Query Templates) completed
- [ ] LangChain framework configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 24-32
- Parallel: false (depends on safety and templates)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 7 agents implemented and unit tested
- [ ] Agent pipeline integration tested end-to-end
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic implemented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (< 3 second response)
- [ ] Documentation of agent interactions
