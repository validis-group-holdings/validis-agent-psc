# Task: Setup & Configuration

## Description
Initialize Node.js service with LangChain framework, configure environment variables for Anthropic Claude integration, and establish database connection with proper upload table pattern enforcement.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Node.js/Express project initialized with TypeScript support
- [ ] LangChain installed and configured for Anthropic Claude
- [ ] Environment variables configured (WORKFLOW_MODE, CLIENT_ID, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_MODEL)
- [ ] Database connection established with read-only access
- [ ] Upload table query pattern helper functions created
- [ ] Redis connection configured for caching
- [ ] Basic health check endpoint working

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Use Express generator with TypeScript template
- Key files: `src/server.ts`, `src/config/`, `src/db/connection.ts`
- LangChain version compatible with Anthropic
- SQL Server connection using appropriate Node.js driver
- Environment validation on startup

## Dependencies
- [ ] Access to database credentials
- [ ] Anthropic API key
- [ ] Redis instance available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12
- Parallel: false (foundation task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with proper error handling
- [ ] Environment variables documented in `.env.example`
- [ ] Database connection tested with sample query
- [ ] README updated with setup instructions
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
