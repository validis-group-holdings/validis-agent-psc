# Task: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

## Description
Initialize the Node.js backend and React frontend projects with TypeScript configuration. Set up the mssql database connection with proper pooling and integrate the Anthropic SDK for Claude Sonnet 4 model access.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Node.js backend project initialized with TypeScript
- [ ] React frontend project created with TypeScript
- [ ] mssql package configured with connection pooling
- [ ] Anthropic SDK integrated and tested with API key
- [ ] Environment variables configured (.env.example created)
- [ ] Basic project structure established (src/, tests/, etc.)

## Technical Details
- Use Express or Fastify for backend API framework
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Set up nodemon/tsx for development hot-reload
- Create database connection singleton with retry logic
- Test Anthropic connection with simple prompt

## Dependencies
- [ ] SQL Server database credentials
- [ ] Anthropic API key for Claude Sonnet 4
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed locally

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12
- Parallel: false (foundational task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Both projects initialize and run without errors
- [ ] Database connection test succeeds
- [ ] Anthropic API test call succeeds
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Basic README with setup instructions
