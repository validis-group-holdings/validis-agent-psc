# Stream B: Chat & Query API Routes

## Scope
Create chat and query execution API endpoints with proper validation and streaming support

## Files Created
- ✅ `backend/src/routes/chat.routes.ts` - Chat endpoint with SSE streaming
- ✅ `backend/src/routes/query.routes.ts` - Query execution with multiple formats
- ✅ `backend/src/middleware/validation.ts` - Zod validation schemas
- ✅ `backend/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts` - Rate limiting middleware
- ✅ `backend/tests/routes/chat.test.ts` - Chat endpoint tests
- ✅ `backend/tests/routes/query.test.ts` - Query endpoint tests

## Implementation Details

### Chat Routes (`/api/chat`)
- **POST /api/chat** - Process natural language queries
  - Validates requests with Zod schemas
  - Supports SSE streaming for real-time updates
  - Handles clarification requests
  - Includes rate limiting (10 req/min)
  - Returns optimized SQL and explanations
  
- **GET /api/chat/health** - Check agent system health
  - Reports status of all agents
  - Includes performance metrics
  
- **POST /api/chat/clear-cache** - Clear coordinator cache
  - Admin-only endpoint with strict rate limiting
  
- **GET /api/chat/active-flows** - Monitor active coordination flows

### Query Routes (`/api/query`)
- **POST /api/query/execute** - Execute validated SQL
  - Supports JSON, CSV, and Excel formats
  - Implements result caching (5 min TTL)
  - Handles parameterized queries
  - Rate limited (30 req/min)
  - Includes execution metrics in headers
  
- **POST /api/query/validate** - Validate SQL without execution
  - Returns errors, warnings, and suggestions
  - Analyzes query complexity
  
- **POST /api/query/explain** - Get query execution plan
  - Returns estimated costs and optimization hints
  
- **GET /api/query/history/:clientId** - Query execution history
  - Paginated results
  - Tracks execution times and row counts

### Validation Middleware
- Comprehensive Zod schemas for all endpoints
- Request ID generation and tracking
- SQL sanitization to prevent injection
- Custom error formatting
- Request/response logging

### Rate Limiting
- Endpoint-specific limits:
  - Chat: 10 req/min (expensive AI operations)
  - Query: 30 req/min (database operations)
  - Validation: 100 req/min (lightweight checks)
  - Admin: 5 req/min (sensitive operations)
- In-memory store with automatic cleanup
- Rate limit headers in responses
- Dynamic rate limiting based on system load

### Key Features Implemented
1. ✅ Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming chat responses
2. ✅ Multiple response formats (JSON, CSV, Excel)
3. ✅ Comprehensive validation with Zod
4. ✅ Rate limiting with configurable limits
5. ✅ Query result caching
6. ✅ SQL injection prevention
7. ✅ Request ID tracking
8. ✅ Detailed error handling
9. ✅ Integration tests with mocking
10. ✅ Health monitoring endpoints

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for validation middleware
- Integration tests for all endpoints
- Rate limiting verification
- Error handling scenarios
- Caching behavior
- Streaming response tests

## Dependencies Added
The following dependencies need to be installed:
```bash
npm install zod json2csv exceljs
npm install --save-dev @types/supertest supertest
```

## Next Steps
- Integration with authentication middleware (when available)
- Add OpenAPI documentation
- Implement request queuing for rate-limited requests
- Add metrics collection for monitoring
- Consider adding GraphQL endpoint for complex queries

## Notes
- Rate limits are configurable and may need adjustment based on load testing
- Cache TTL (5 minutes) can be configured via environment variables
- Excel export limited to 1M rows for performance reasons
- SSE connections have a 30-second keep-alive ping
