# Project Progress

## Current Status
- **Project Stage**: Proof of Concept (POC) Development
- **Repository**: validis-agent-psc (GitHub: validis-group-holdings/validis-agent-psc)
- **Current Branch**: main
- **Git Status**: Clean (up to date with origin/main)

## Recent Work Completed
1. **PRD Creation**: Comprehensive Product Requirements Document for Validis Agent
   - Defined 8 lending templates with specific thresholds
   - Defined 8 audit templates with clear criteria
   - Established business logic and performance requirements
   - Added technical architecture details

2. **Database Schema Analysis**
   - Explored SQL Server database structure
   - Identified core tables: upload, transactionHeader/Line, saleHeader/Line, purchaseHeader/Line
   - Analyzed data relationships and volume (110K+ GL entries, 8K+ AR, 24K+ AP)
   - Defined optimal query patterns using clustered indexes

3. **Project Scaffolding**
   - Established Claude.ai project structure with agents, commands, and rules
   - Created context management system
   - Set up project instructions and conventions

## Recent Commits
- `ac983a3` - Full Scaffold (latest)
- `d05cd8d` - More context
- `100f089` - Adding more solution context for codex
- `3523682` - Codex init
- `d8a6bc3` - first commit

## In Progress
- Context documentation creation
- Architecture planning for multi-agent system
- Template implementation strategy

## Next Steps
1. **Architecture Design**
   - Design multi-agent orchestration system
   - Define agent responsibilities (Orchestrator, Lending, Audit, Query Optimizer)
   - Plan natural language to SQL translation approach

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Create React/TypeScript dashboard interface
   - Implement chat interface with template selection
   - Design data visualization components

3. **Backend Implementation**
   - Set up agent framework
   - Implement SQL query generation logic
   - Create multi-tenant isolation layer
   - Establish database connection management

4. **Template Implementation**
   - Code lending portfolio templates
   - Code audit company-specific templates
   - Implement query optimization strategies

## Known Issues
- No active development environment set up yet
- No package.json or project dependencies defined
- Database connection details need to be configured

## Development Priorities
1. Define technology stack and create package.json
2. Set up development environment with TypeScript/React
3. Implement core agent architecture
4. Create first working template (proof of concept)
5. Test multi-tenant isolation thoroughly

## Key Decisions Made
- Portfolio queries limited to 3 months for performance
- Always use clustered index (uploadId) for queries
- Company matching via exact name match
- Original currency display (no conversion)
- After hours defined as weekdays after 6pm + weekends

## Performance Targets
- Query response time: <1 minute (ideally <30 seconds)
- Support millions of transactions
- Result sets limited to 5000 rows initially
- Real-time processing (no batch delays)
