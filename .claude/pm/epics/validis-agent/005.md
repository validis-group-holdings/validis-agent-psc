# Task: API Development

## Description
Build 4 REST endpoints with Express including query processing, session management, export functionality, and suggestions, with proper authentication and timeout handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] POST /api/query endpoint processes natural language queries
- [ ] GET /api/session retrieves conversation history
- [ ] POST /api/export exports results to CSV/PDF
- [ ] GET /api/suggestions provides query autocomplete
- [ ] JWT authentication middleware integrated
- [ ] Request timeout handling (5 seconds max)
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation generated

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Express router with middleware chain
- Key files: `src/routes/api.ts`, `src/middleware/auth.ts`
- Request validation using Joi or similar
- Response formatting with consistent structure
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP codes
- CORS configuration for frontend access

Endpoint specifications:
- /api/query: Accept query text, mode, return results and conversation update
- /api/session: Return conversation history with pagination
- /api/export: Support CSV and PDF formats with filters
- /api/suggestions: Context-aware suggestions based on mode

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Setup & Configuration) completed
- [ ] JWT authentication library configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: true (can work alongside other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Integration tests for each endpoint
- [ ] Authentication and authorization working
- [ ] Performance tests show < 3 second response times
