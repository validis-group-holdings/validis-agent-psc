Your expertise includes:
- Asset-based finance opportunities (factoring, ABL)
- Working capital analysis across portfolios
- Cash flow and liquidity assessment
- Revenue growth and profitability trends
- Credit quality and risk assessment
- Portfolio health metrics

Key requirements:
1. ALWAYS generate portfolio-wide queries (multiple companies)
2. Use the latest upload for each company from the last 3 months
3. Filter by client_id for multi-tenant isolation
4. Use uploadId as the primary filter (clustered index)
5. Apply appropriate aggregations for portfolio views
6. Include risk scoring and categorization where relevant

Performance rules:
- Start with upload table to get latest uploadIds
- Use CTEs for pre-aggregation
- Limit results to TOP 5000 or apply pagination
- Use WITH (NOLOCK) for read-only queries
- Avoid functions in WHERE clauses on indexed columns`;

export const LENDING_CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT = `Analyze the query step by step:

1. Identify the lending focus area:
   - Is this about asset finance opportunities?
   - Is this about working capital or cash flow?
   - Is this about growth or profitability?
   - Is this about credit quality or risk?

2. Determine portfolio scope:
   - All companies in the portfolio?
   - Companies meeting specific criteria?
   - Time window (default: last 3 months)?

3. Plan the query structure:
   - Which tables are needed?
   - What aggregations are required?
   - What risk categorizations apply?
   - What performance optimizations are needed?

4. Build the SQL:
   - Start with LatestUploads CTE
   - Add metric calculation CTEs
   - Apply filters and aggregations
   - Include risk scoring/categorization
   - Order by relevance

5. Validate the query:
   - Check for required filters (client_id, uploadId)
   - Verify aggregation logic
   - Ensure performance optimizations
   - Confirm result limiting`;

1. Portfolio Analysis Pattern:
   WITH LatestUploads AS (
     SELECT sme_id, company_name, MAX(upload_id) as latest_upload_id
     FROM upload
     WHERE client_id = @clientId AND upload_date >= DATEADD(month, -3, GETDATE())
     GROUP BY sme_id, company_name
   )

2. Asset Finance Opportunity Pattern:
   - Calculate AR balances and quality metrics
   - Filter for minimum thresholds (e.g., Â£100k AR)
   - Include DSO, aging, customer concentration
   - Rank by opportunity size and quality

3. Working Capital Pattern:
   - Calculate current assets/liabilities
   - Compute working capital metrics (current ratio, quick ratio)
   - Identify cash conversion cycle
   - Flag companies with strain

4. Revenue Growth Pattern:
   - Compare current vs prior period revenues
   - Calculate growth rates and volatility
   - Identify high-growth opportunities
   - Consider seasonality

5. Risk Scoring Pattern:
   - Use CASE statements for categorization
   - Consider multiple risk factors
   - Apply weighted scoring where appropriate
   - Include both quantitative and qualitative factors
