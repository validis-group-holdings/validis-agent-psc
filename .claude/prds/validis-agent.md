## Executive Summary

The Validis Agent is an agentic chatbot proof of concept that enables audit firms and lenders to query standardized financial data using natural language. The system eliminates the need for manual SQL queries or Excel manipulation by providing an intuitive chat interface with pre-defined templates and intelligent query generation. The solution leverages specialized AI agents to understand context, generate optimized SQL queries, and present results in meaningful visualizations.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Technical Barrier**: Audit managers, junior auditors, and relationship managers lack SQL expertise but need to query complex financial databases
- **Manual Processes**: Users currently rely on manual Excel spreadsheet modifications and custom SQL scripts
- **Time Inefficiency**: Creating and modifying queries for portfolio analysis or audit procedures is time-consuming
- **Data Access Friction**: Users need quick insights from standardized financial data but face technical barriers

### Why Now
- Advances in LLM technology enable natural language to SQL translation
- Growing demand for real-time financial insights
- Need to democratize data access for non-technical users
- Competitive advantage through faster audit and lending decisions

- Network connectivity for database access
- Client-specific environment variables configuration

### Internal Team Dependencies
- Database team: Schema documentation and access credentials
- DevOps team: Environment setup and deployment
- Product team: Template refinement and user acceptance criteria
- QA team: Testing multi-tenant isolation and performance
- Customer Success: Pilot customer coordination

### Technical Dependencies
- Database schema documentation
- Table relationships mapping

- AR (Accounts Receivable) data
- AP (Accounts Payable) data
- Historical audit data for comparison queries

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Query Performance**: Mitigate with query optimization agent and result limiting
- **Data Isolation**: Rigorous testing of client_id filtering
- **Ambiguous Queries**: Clear fallback to user clarification

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Intuitive templates and UI design
- **Accuracy Concerns**: Query explanation feature and validation testing
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed for horizontal scaling

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
- **Core Tables**:
  - `upload`: Company data uploads (filtered by client_id)
  - `transactionHeader/Line`: General ledger entries
  - `saleHeader/Line`: Accounts receivable
  - `purchaseHeader/Line`: Accounts payable
  - `saleAged/purchaseAged`: Aging analysis
  - `account`: Chart of accounts
  - `customer/supplier`: Counterparty master data

### Query Patterns
1. **Portfolio Queries** (Lending):
   ```sql
   SELECT company_id, metrics
   FROM relevant_tables
   WHERE client_id = @client_id
   AND upload_date >= DATEADD(month, -3, GETDATE())
   GROUP BY company_id
   ```

2. **Company Queries** (Audit):
   ```sql
   SELECT transaction_details
   FROM relevant_tables
   WHERE uploadId = (SELECT TOP 1 upload_id FROM upload 
                     WHERE client_id = @client_id 
                     AND sme_id = @company_id
                     ORDER BY upload_date DESC)
   ```

### Data Access Strategy
- Always filter by uploadId for performance (clustered index)
- Use latest upload per company unless historical comparison needed
- Company name matching: Exact match on company name from upload table
- Date comparisons use financialPeriodId for consistency
- Monetary values kept in original currency (no conversion)
