# Task: Integration Testing & Optimization

## Description
Conduct comprehensive integration testing of all 16 template scenarios, verify multi-tenant isolation works correctly, and optimize agent prompts based on test results to improve accuracy and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 16 templates tested end-to-end
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified (no data leaks)
- [ ] Query accuracy reaches 90%+
- [ ] Response times under 30 seconds
- [ ] Agent prompts refined based on failures
- [ ] Test report documenting results

## Technical Details
- Create test suite for each template
- Use different client_ids for isolation testing
- Measure query generation accuracy
- Profile performance bottlenecks
- Document prompt improvements
- Create regression test suite

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 009 completed (full system ready)
- [ ] Test data available in database
- [ ] All 16 templates defined
- [ ] Performance targets established

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24
- Parallel: false (final validation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All templates pass integration tests
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation confirmed
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Prompts optimized for accuracy
- [ ] Test documentation complete
- [ ] Ready for POC demonstration
