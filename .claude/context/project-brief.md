# Project Brief

## Executive Summary
Validis Agent is a proof-of-concept AI chatbot that democratizes access to financial data for audit firms and lenders. By converting natural language queries into optimized SQL, it enables non-technical users to extract insights from standardized financial databases without SQL knowledge or Excel manipulation.

## Problem We're Solving

### Current State
- **Manual Process**: Users spend hours writing SQL queries or manipulating Excel
- **Technical Barrier**: Business users lack SQL expertise but need data insights
- **Inefficiency**: Each query requires technical support or lengthy manual work
- **Missed Opportunities**: Delayed decisions due to data access friction

### Impact
- Audit managers can't quickly identify exceptions
- Relationship managers miss lending opportunities
- Junior staff require constant technical support
- Organizations underutilize their data assets

## Project Scope

### In Scope (POC)
✅ Natural language to SQL translation
✅ 16 pre-defined templates (8 lending, 8 audit)
✅ Multi-tenant data isolation
✅ Real-time query processing
✅ Basic data visualizations
✅ Chat-based interface
✅ Query explanation and reasoning

### Out of Scope (POC)
❌ Custom template creation
❌ Export functionality (Excel/PDF)
❌ User authentication system
❌ Audit trail UI
❌ Platform integrations
❌ Mobile application
❌ Multi-language support

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Democratize Data Access**
   - Enable non-technical users to query databases
   - Remove SQL knowledge requirement
   - Provide instant insights

2. **Accelerate Decision Making**
   - <1 minute query response time
   - Real-time processing
   - Clear, actionable results

3. **Ensure Data Security**
   - Multi-tenant isolation
   - No cross-client data leakage
   - Secure query execution

### Success Criteria
- **Technical**: All 16 templates functioning correctly
- **Performance**: 95% of queries complete in <1 minute
- **Usability**: Users can complete tasks without training
- **Security**: Zero data breach incidents
- **Business**: 80% time reduction vs manual methods

## Key Deliverables

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Product Requirements Document
- [x] Technical architecture design
- [x] Database schema analysis
- [ ] Development environment setup

### Phase 2: Core Development
- [ ] Multi-agent system implementation
- [ ] Template query builders
- [ ] Natural language processor
- [ ] Database connection layer

### Phase 3: User Interface
- [ ] React dashboard
- [ ] Chat interface component
- [ ] Template selection UI
- [ ] Results visualization

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit test coverage
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Security validation

### Phase 5: Pilot Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to test environment
- [ ] Pilot with key customers (Barclays, Santander, PWC)
- [ ] Gather feedback
- [ ] Iterate based on usage

## Target Outcomes

### For Users
- **Efficiency**: 10x faster than manual SQL/Excel
- **Accessibility**: No technical skills required
- **Confidence**: Clear explanations with results
- **Productivity**: Focus on analysis, not data extraction

### For Organizations
- **ROI**: Reduce technical support needs
- **Scalability**: Serve more users without more resources
- **Competitive Edge**: Faster lending/audit decisions
- **Risk Reduction**: Consistent, accurate queries

### For Validis
- **Market Position**: First-mover in AI financial querying
- **Customer Value**: Enhanced platform offering
- **Revenue Potential**: New subscription tier
- **Strategic Asset**: Foundation for AI-powered features

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing SQL Server database
- Cannot modify database schema
- Limited to English language initially
- 5000 row result limit

### Business Constraints
- POC timeline: 3-4 months
- Limited development resources
- Must maintain data security
- No production deployment initially

### Key Assumptions
- LLM technology sufficient for query translation
- Users comfortable with chat interfaces
- Database performance adequate
- Network connectivity reliable

## Risk Summary

### High Priority Risks
1. **Query Performance**: Mitigate with optimization agent
2. **Data Security**: Strict client_id isolation
3. **LLM Accuracy**: Template system reduces errors
4. **User Adoption**: Intuitive UI and templates

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling
2. **Complex Queries**: Fallback to clarification
3. **Database Load**: Query optimization and limits
4. **Support Burden**: Comprehensive help system
