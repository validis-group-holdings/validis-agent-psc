# Project Brief

## Project Name
Claude Code Project Management (CCPM) System

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive project management and context preservation system designed to enhance AI-assisted software development with Claude Code. The system provides structured workflows, intelligent agent orchestration, and persistent context management to maximize development efficiency and maintain project continuity.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Project management commands and workflows
- Context documentation system
- Agent-based task processing
- GitHub integration
- PRD and epic management
- Issue analysis and decomposition
- Cross-platform installation support
- Living documentation maintenance

### Out of Scope
- Direct code generation
- External API integrations (except GitHub)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Cloud hosting services
- Paid features or subscriptions

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Eliminate Context Loss**: Preserve project knowledge between Claude Code sessions
2. **Optimize Token Usage**: Reduce context consumption through intelligent agents
3. **Streamline Workflows**: Provide efficient project management commands
4. **Enable Continuity**: Maintain project momentum across sessions

### Specific Objectives
- Achieve 80% context preservation between sessions
- Reduce token usage by 70% for multi-file operations
- Provide sub-5 second command execution
- Support 100% of common PM operations
- Enable parallel processing for complex tasks

## Why This Exists

### Problem Statement
Developers using Claude Code face significant challenges:
- Loss of context between sessions
- Token limit constraints with large codebases
- Inefficient project management workflows
- Lack of structured documentation
- No standardized AI-assistant patterns

### Solution Approach
CCPM addresses these challenges through:
- Persistent context documentation
- Agent-based processing to preserve tokens
- Structured command system
- GitHub-native integration
- Standardized workflows and patterns

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- 90% of context preserved between sessions
- 70% reduction in main thread token usage
- <5 second average command execution time
- 95% command success rate
- Zero context corruption incidents

### Qualitative Metrics
- Improved developer productivity
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better project organization
- Enhanced AI collaboration
- Consistent development patterns

## Key Stakeholders

### Direct Stakeholders
- **Developers**: Primary users of the system
- **Project Managers**: Use PM features
- **Technical Leads**: Oversee implementation

### Indirect Stakeholders
- **Clients**: Benefit from improved delivery
- **Organizations**: Gain efficiency improvements
- **Open Source Community**: Contribute and benefit

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work within Claude Code's tool system
- GitHub CLI dependency
- Cross-platform compatibility requirement
- Token limit considerations

### Resource Constraints
- Single repository structure
- Local file system only
- No external servers
- Open source model

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- Claude Code API changes
- GitHub API modifications
- Platform compatibility issues
- Performance degradation with scale

### Mitigation Strategies
- Version compatibility checks
- Graceful degradation
- Fallback mechanisms
- Performance monitoring

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Ease of Use**: Commands must be intuitive
2. **Reliability**: System must be stable and predictable
3. **Performance**: Fast execution and response times
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive and current
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
- Core system setup
- Basic commands

## Expected Outcomes

### Short Term (1-3 months)
- Fully functional PM system
- Complete context preservation
- Stable agent orchestration
- Comprehensive documentation

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
- Extended command library
- Performance optimizations
- Community contributions
- Integration ecosystem

### Long Term (6-12 months)
