# Task: Deployment & DevOps

## Description
Dockerize the application with resource limits, create Kubernetes manifests for deployment, set up monitoring alerts, and establish CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dockerfile created with multi-stage build
- [ ] Docker image size < 500MB
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests for deployment, service, ingress
- [ ] Resource limits configured (CPU, memory)
- [ ] Health check and readiness probes configured
- [ ] Monitoring alerts for key metrics
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Secrets management implemented

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Multi-stage Docker build for optimization
- Key files: `Dockerfile`, `k8s/`, `.github/workflows/`
- Container registry setup (Docker Hub or private)
- Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana or Datadog
- Log aggregation configuration

Deployment components:
- Docker: Node.js Alpine image, security scanning
- Kubernetes: Deployment with 3 replicas, HPA for scaling
- Monitoring: Query performance, error rates, response times
- CI/CD: Build, test, deploy stages with approvals
- Secrets: Environment variables, API keys, database credentials

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 008 (Testing) completed
- [ ] Access to Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Container registry access
- [ ] Monitoring infrastructure available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: false (final deployment task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Application successfully deployed to staging
- [ ] All health checks passing
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline tested end-to-end
- [ ] Deployment documentation complete
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested
