# Task: Query Safety Layer

## Description
Implement query validator, governor, and performance monitoring agents to ensure all queries are safe, performant, and properly scoped to client_id with upload table pattern enforcement.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Query Validator agent validates upload table pattern usage
- [ ] Client ID scoping enforced on every query
- [ ] Query Governor injects TOP clauses (max 100 rows default)
- [ ] 5-second timeout implementation on all queries
- [ ] Query cost estimator prevents expensive operations
- [ ] Row count limits enforced (10,000 max)
- [ ] Performance monitoring logs query execution times

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create middleware chain for query processing
- Key files: `src/agents/queryValidator.ts`, `src/agents/queryGovernor.ts`
- Use SQL query parser to analyze queries before execution
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing queries
- Log all queries with execution metrics

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Setup & Configuration) completed
- [ ] Database connection established

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: true (can work alongside task 003)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All safety agents implemented and unit tested
- [ ] Integration tests validate safety rules
- [ ] Performance metrics logged to monitoring system
- [ ] Documentation of safety rules and limits
- [ ] Code reviewed for security vulnerabilities
